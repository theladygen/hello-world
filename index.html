          <h3>Meet Oliver...</h3>
          <p>
            My family found me roaming around the neighborhood when I was small. As a wild beastie it was not the easiest transition to house life, but the food is solid and the catnip flows on the regular. I rule my pride with an iron claw. Really, I’m a softie at heart, but don’t tell them that.<br>
            <br>
            Likes: chin scritches, a good case of the poop zoomies, and walking around my cat enclosure like the majestic puma that I am.<br>
            <br>
            Dislikes: Bug always up in my bidness, car rides, and the cursed vet.

          <p>
            Mom brought me and my brother, Fox, home when we were just little floofs. I am the premier princess furlady of this house. I do drool, and I really, really like to sniff everything then sneeze on it, but come on… with a face like this I can get away with just about anything.<br>
            <br>
            Likes: my favorite sparkly crunchy ball cat toy, snuggling with mom, and humans sweet talking me.<br>
            <br>
            Dislikes: these dang boys always chasing me around, the terrifying thing mom calls "vacuum", and those gross freeze dried whole little fish treats. Ew, David!

            Hi! I’m the goodest boy! Mom always says so. At least, I think she does. She moves her mouth and smiles a lot at me. I can’t hear anything, but I’m pretty sure she’s telling me she loves me, like, all the time. Sometimes I see things that everyone else says isn't actually there. Man, I feel sorry for them. Doh, just saw a bird! Later, friend!<br>
            <br>Likes: extreme-lean-on-into-them ear scritches, my sister, Sophie (she's the purrdiest), and meowing, yowling, and generally chattering in ALLTHEWAYS! I can’t actually hear myself, but it kinda feels good, and it’s super fun!<br>
            <br>Dislikes: do NOT touch my toe beans, OR pick me up. Ssssscary. Also, purrlease to not be messing with me to look at my teefs. Yes, there are adorable. No, you cannot see.

            It’s rough being the most handsome guy. I’m a little shy, honestly. Being such a looker, everyone wants to touch me! I’m really good at hiding though, so it’s cool. Mom is nice to cuddle with, and she’s great at doling out a solid selection of treats. Plus, I get to live with my brother, Bug. Life is good.<br>
            <br>Likes: treats. Do you have more treats? Where are the treats? Burrowing and digging under the covers with my sharp claws to sleep. Not sure why mom says, "Ow!" so much. Ooo, and I love breakfast. No, wait. Dinner. Gah! Let's call it brinner.<br>
            <br>Dislikes: new people trying to touch me (why everybody always gotta touch me?!), loud terrifying noises, and being brushed. The torture!

            Did you come here to pet me?? I definitely like pets. I also like rough housing, chasing my roommates, and then pulling a full 180 gear switch to laying down EXACTLY where they are and try to groom and cuddle them. 9 times out of 10 it makes them move. I don’t get it. It’s weird how grumpy they get about all o’ that fun stuff. Oh well. My brother, Albus, doesn't seem to mind too much. Man, I love that guy!<br>
            <br>Likes: PETS! Do you wanna pet me? You should pet me. Those crunchy little salmon cube treats (holy yum!), and chasing, grooming, generally harassing my roommates. A Booger's gotta booger.<br>
            <br>Dislikes: that horrifyingly scary shaver thing mom always gets out to trim my hairballs, being told no (as if!), and mom cleaning my eye boogers. Dang, Ma! I worked hard to make those.
